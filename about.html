      <p class="h4 mt-5 mb-5">About</p>
      <p class="h5">Education</p>
      <p class="h6 mt-3">I have a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology, Specializing in Software Engineering.</p>
      <p class="h5">Experience</p>

      <p class="h6 mt-3">I was an intern at a Media Network Company for 2 months and my responsibilities included:</p>
      <ul class="unstyled-list text-left">
        <li class="mt-3">Changing the website layout & design, adding plugins and data entry using WordPress.</li>
        <li>Assisting co-workers in any difficulties with their computers.</li>
        <li>Handling the company’s social media accounts.</li>
        <li>Troubleshooting network problems and diagnosing and solving hardware or software faults.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="h6 mt-3">This internship introduced me to WordPress CMS and with time I became familiar with how it works. I learned how to solve tasks and do it before the deadline and this improved my researching skills. I also learned how to work under pressure because the company was reliant on the interns to solve all tech related problems.</p>
      <p class="h6 ">After graduating, I decided to become a Web Developer but I didn't have a luck applying for jobs so I started doing side projects to improve my skills and make up for the experience. All of them can be seen in the Projects page including this website.</p>
      <p class="h5 mb-4 mt-3">Skills:</p>
      <div class="skills">
        <span class="badge">HTML5</span>
        <span class="badge">CSS3</span>
        <span class="badge">JavaScript</span>
        <span class="badge">Bootstrap 4</span>
        <span class="badge">WordPress</span>
        <span class="badge">Git</span>
        <span class="badge">PHP</span>
        <span class="badge">MySQL</span>
      </div>

      <p class="h6 mt-3">
        I try to use the best practices and make my code clean and modern so I include the HTML5 new elements to structure my document and for CSS, I create most of the layouts using CSS Grid. I rely on the browser dev tools in CSS to work with Firefox’s Grid Inspector Tool and in JavaScript to work with the DOM tree, the console & storage inspector.
      </p>
      <p class="h6">
        I used PHP & MySQL to create websites using dreamweaver. I am also familiar with Java & C++ syntax and did a few school projects.
